# Argo-Training-Examples

Welcome to the Argo Training Lab repository! This repository is geared towards assisting users in getting familiar with Argo, by providing practical examples and configuration files.

---

Within this repository, you'll find several YAML files organized in dedicated folders for ease of access and clarity:

- In the argocd folder, there are two YAML files: deployment.yaml and service.yaml. These files are designed for you to customize and use as a hands-on approach to learn how to update configurations using ArgoCD.
- Additionally, in the argo-events folder, you will find the pulsar.yaml file. This file is set up to help you create a pod of Apache Pulsar, enabling you to experiment with Argo Events and understand its integration with external systems.
  
This setup aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience for both ArgoCD and Argo Events, offering you the tools to effectively understand and manage different aspects of Argo in a practical environment.
