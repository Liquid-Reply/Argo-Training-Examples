# Argo-Training-Examples

Welcome to the ArgoCD Training Lab repository! This repository is designed to help users of the ArgoCD Training Lab get started with forking and configuring YAML files for their training needs.

The repository currently contains two YAML files: deployment.yaml and service.yaml. These files are meant for customization to practice updating configurations using ArgoCD.
